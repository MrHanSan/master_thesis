\chapter{Discussion}
When traversing an rdf graph, the predicates chosen will have a great effect on the time used. Knowing the data searching through will help when choosing the predicate to follow. When choosing what predicates to use in the search, the goal should be to minimize the amount of unnecessary nodes found and followed. When removing predicates, the obvious downside is the possibility of missing some results, and decreasing the accuracy.\\
