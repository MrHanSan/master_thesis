\subsection{Pruning}
When using the BFS search method, all possible spatial vertices close to the queried place will be explored. This is expensive and many of the vertices will be irrelevant. Pruning the potential place vertices will reduce the amount of subgraphs traversed, and will in turn reduce the overall time used to find results for the query.
