\subsection{Pruning} \label{pruning}
When using the BFS search method, all possible spatial vertices close to the queried place will be explored. This is expensive and many of the vertices will be irrelevant. Pruning the potential place vertices will reduce the amount of subgraphs traversed, and will in turn reduce the overall time used to find results for the query.

- predicate pruning \\
When traversing the graph a lot of unnecessary predicates are followed, resulting in many extra nodes added to the search. Specifying a set of predicates that contain the relevant information can greatly increase the speed of the algorithm, and also keep the memory requirements a lot lower. When selecting predicates for traversal the information expected from the search should be the top priority. Because of this, all predicates that may contain spatial or temporal data should be kept. 

- unqualified place pruning.\\
For any spatial search, a lot of places will be found. The graph also contains information on the relationship between places. To find the best possible matches for a spatial query, only places of a higher resolution should be chosen. This means that places of similar or smaller expanse should be allows to be queried, e.g. a query of Boston can return the entirety of Boston, close to Boston, or within Boston. Massachusetts has multiple predicates linking it to Boston, but should not be queried because the information returned would be less detailed than what is queried. 

- Bounding.\\
When selecting places or times for a query, the boundaries should be set so that they encompass the entirety of the queried time and or place.
