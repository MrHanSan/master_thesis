\section*{Abstract}
This thesis looks at methods for using keywords for search in graph structured data, with the goal of finding what aspects are needed for accuracy and speed. To accomplish this, some previous methods for keyword searching will be recreated, and then extended to incorporate both spatial and temporal searches.
