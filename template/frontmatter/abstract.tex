\section*{Abstract}
This thesis looks at methods for using keyword searching in spatiotemporal graph data, with the goal of finding what aspects are needed for accuracy and speed. The goal is to recreate previous methods used, and through testing determine what aspects of an algorithm have most impact on the speed and accuracy of finding and ranking results.
